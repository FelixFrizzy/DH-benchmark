# DH Benchmark Dataset for Ontology Matching

## Description

This is a benchmark dataset for ontology matching in the field of Digital Humanities (DH) created by Felix Kraus. You can find all the general information about the dataset that you need for using it at the [OAEI](https://oaei.ontologymatching.org/) in this repository.
For further information on the [OAEI 2024](http://oaei.ontologymatching.org/2024/) see also [here](https://felixfrizzy.github.io/DH-benchmark/).   
This benchmark dataset facilitaes the development of ontology matching systems for the Humanities, which face special obstacle which are at least partly addressed in this dataset:

- wide range of (historical) languages and writing systems
- domain-specific terms with a small research community at times
- use of a data model suitable for easily creating knowledge organization systems

## Test Cases

The dataset includes several test cases grouped into three sub-domains. Each test case consists of a source ontology, a target ontology and a manually compiled reference alignment. Only equivalent relations ("=") are targeted.

### DH and Computer Science (foldername "dhcs...")

There were five different vocabularies used for the two different DH/CS test cases:
- [DHA Taxonomy](https://vocabs.dariah.eu/dha_taxonomy/en/) [7]
    - About 115 terms

    - Reference: 170*490=83300 possible combinations, 16 true positivs (~0,02%)

## Test Case Design
The following criteria were used to select suitable controlled vocabularies (CVs) from all DH CVs that were found:
- The track should cover different subfields of Humanities
- Preferably specific terminology than general to pose a challenge to the OM systems
- CV is in SKOS format (unlike e.g. plain HTML CVs that could not be used)
- A combination of two CVs needs to have at least some true positivs
- CVs with errors such as doublette terms, terms not in hierarchy, violation of SKOS were not considered

Some potential test cases are hold back for the following OAEI years such that the systems always encounter unseen test cases.

## Reference Alignment Methodology / Provenance
To create a well designed reference alignment, the following points were taken into account:
- Special care was taken to ensure that similar terms are really identical and not closely related, see [10]
- Only the same part-of-speech was considered to be similar (e.g. analysis and to analyse was not considered to be similar)
- Singular and plural was considered to be similar
- Large vocabularies were reduced to only the relevant terms. This means that the branch of the hierarchy containing terms of the desired topic was kept and the other branches was removed. This ensures that the reference alignment can be compiled manually. 
To create the manual alignment, the dataset creator went through each term of the source CV and searched thouroughly for similar terms in the target CV using full text search and its hierarchy.
