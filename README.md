# DH Benchmark Dataset for Ontology Matching

introduction + link to OAEI 2024

# Description

This is a benchmark dataset for ontology matching in the field of Digital Humanities (DH). You can find all the information about the dataset that you need for using it at the [OAEI](https://oaei.ontologymatching.org/) in this repository.  
This benchmark dataset facilitaes the development of ontology matching systems for the Humanities, which face special obstacle which are at least partly addressed in this dataset:

- wide range of (historical) languages and writing systems
- domain-specific terms with a small research community at times
- use of a data model suitable for easily creating knowledge organization systems

## Test Cases

The dataset includes several test cases grouped into three sub-domains. Each test case consists of a source ontology, a target ontology and a manually compiled reference alignment. Only equivalent relations ("=") are targeted.

### Archaeology
